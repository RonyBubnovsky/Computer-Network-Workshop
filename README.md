# Computer Networking Workshop Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I completed as part of a computer networking workshop. The projects cover various fundamental aspects of networking, including UDP and TCP protocols, peer-to-peer communication, and optimizing connections based on Round-Trip Time (RTT).

## Projects Overview

1. **Basic UDP**
2. **Basic TCP**
3. **TCP P2P**
4. **Connect to Minimum RTT**

Each project has its own folder with specific instructions on how to run and understand the implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of networking principles.
- Familiarity with socket programming (e.g., Python, C, Java).

## Usage

This repository is free to use. Feel free to explore the projects and provide any feedback or suggestions.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the instructors and peers who provided guidance and support throughout the workshop. This experience has significantly enhanced my understanding of computer networking.
